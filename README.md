# CloudComputing-LoadBalancer
This is the second project of TAMU CSCE412 Cloud Computing Class

The code has already been complied. To run it, simply type the command `./a.out` in the command line. The program will ask user to input the number of servers and the time clocks for the program. After that, the program will output the result line by line as the format "At ____ _ process request from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx to yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy" where x and y are numbers and represent the IPv4 addresses, "____" and "_" represent the time and server name(in alphabet).

To edit the code and re-compile it, simply type `g++ main.cpp` after editing and use the instruction above to re-run the program.
